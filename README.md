# Istio studies and quick-wins

repo to organize my istio studies and flow of though

# study-flow suggestions:
```
0 - installation
1 - telemetry
2 - routing
3 - circuit-breaking
3 - mTLS
(opt-ins)
4 - chaos
5 - edge
```

each folder contains a quick readme with my thoughts on the subject, and some commented yaml files with basic funcitionality that can be adapted.


# up to date with istio: v1.9
